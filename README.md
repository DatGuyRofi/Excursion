# Excursion practice site

This simple website was created to complete one assignment from my programming course. The languages used were HTML and CSS. The video and the images were provided by the course program as material to use. 

The only confusing part about the code is in the CSS file. Applying the desired style to the link would only work with:

nav, a {
    color: aquamarine;
    font-size: 16px;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: Verdana;
    font-weight: bold;
}

it has been left like that since it works and does not create any problem in how the site is displayed and its functionality.
