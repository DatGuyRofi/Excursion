# Excursion practice site

This simple website was created to complete one assignment from my programming course. It is a very simple site taht makes use of HTML and CSS. 

The video and the images were provided by the course program as material to use. 

The only part confusing about the code is in the css file. Applying the desired style to the link would only work with:

nav, a {
    color: aquamarine;
    font-size: 16px;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: Verdana;
    font-weight: bold;
}
